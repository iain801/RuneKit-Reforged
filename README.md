# RuneKit Reforged

**Alt1-compatible toolkit for RuneScape 3 on Linux.**

RuneKit Reforged lets you run [Alt1 toolkit](https://runeapps.org/alt1) apps (clue solvers, XP meters, AFK timers, and more) alongside the **official RuneScape 3 client** on Linux. It works by reading your game screen through screenshots — it does not modify the game client.

Forked from [Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged](https://github.com/Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged), based on the original [whs/runekit](https://github.com/whs/runekit). Uses Python 3.11–3.14, Qt6, and modern dependencies.

## What You Need

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Linux with X11 or XWayland |
| **macOS** | macOS 14+ (experimental, untested — Accessibility + Screen Recording permissions required) |
| **Python** | 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14 |
| **RuneScape 3** | Official client must be **running** before you start RuneKit |
| **Display server** | X11, or a Wayland session with the game running through XWayland |

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install system dependencies

**Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint:**
```sh
sudo apt install -y python3-full pipx libxcb-cursor0
```

**Fedora:**
```sh
sudo dnf install -y python3 pipx libxcb-cursor
```

**Arch Linux:**
```sh
sudo pacman -S python pipx xcb-util-cursor
```

### Step 2: Install Poetry (Python package manager)

```sh
pipx install poetry
```

If `pipx` says to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH, do that:
```sh
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Step 3: Clone and install RuneKit Reforged

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iain801/RuneKit-Reforged.git
cd RuneKit-Reforged
poetry install --extras gpu
```

This creates a virtual environment and installs all Python dependencies. It may take a minute.

### Step 4: Build resources

```sh
poetry run make dev
```

### Step 5: Launch

1. **Start RuneScape 3 first** (the official client)
2. Then run:

```sh
poetry run python main.py
```

3. A **system tray icon** will appear in your panel
4. **Right-click the tray icon** to see available Alt1 apps
5. On first launch, RuneKit downloads the default app list from runeapps.org

### One-Click Launcher

After initial setup, you can use the included launcher script:

```sh
./RuneKit.sh
```

This script checks system dependencies, installs Python dependencies including the GPU extra, builds Qt resources, and launches RuneKit. You can double-click it in your file manager too (make sure it's marked executable with `chmod +x RuneKit.sh`).

---

## macOS Quick Start (Building from Source)

> **Note:** Mac support is experimental. If you just want to try it, the [upstream pre-built app](#download) is available, but does not include this fork’s changes.

### Step 1: Install Homebrew dependencies

```sh
brew install python@3.13 poetry
```

### Step 2: Clone and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iain801/RuneKit-Reforged.git
cd RuneKit-Reforged
poetry install
```

### Step 3: Build resources

```sh
poetry run make dev
```

### Step 4: Launch

1. **Start RuneScape 3 first**
2. Then run:

```sh
poetry run python main.py
```

3. When prompted, grant **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions in System Settings

## Available Alt1 Apps

RuneKit automatically downloads these apps on first launch:

| App | What it does |
|---|---|
| **AFKWarden** | Alerts you when you stop gaining XP or need attention |
| **Clue Solver** | Solves clue scroll puzzles, compass clues, and map clues |
| **Stats** | Shows your skill stats and XP tracking |
| **XpMeter** | Real-time XP/hour tracking overlay |
| **RS Wiki** | Quick item/NPC/object lookup from the RS Wiki |
| **DgKey** | Dungeoneering key tracker |
| **Droplogger** | Logs your drops for tracking loot |

You can also load any custom Alt1 app by URL:
```sh
poetry run python main.py https://runeapps.org/apps/alt1/afkscape/appconfig.json
```

Or add apps through the Settings UI:

1. Right-click the system tray icon and open **Settings**
2. Go to the **Applications** tab
3. Click the **+** button
4. Paste the app's `appconfig.json` URL (e.g. `https://runeapps.org/apps/alt1/afkscape/appconfig.json`)

> **Note:** `alt1://addapp/` links (used on runeapps.org to install apps with one click) are not currently supported. If a website gives you an `alt1://` link, copy the URL from the link, strip the `alt1://addapp/` prefix, and paste the remaining `appconfig.json` URL into the Settings dialog instead.

## Troubleshooting

### "No game instance found"

- Make sure RuneScape 3 is **running** before you start RuneKit
- RuneKit detects the game by its window class, or its title and client process. To override the expected window name, set:
  ```sh
  export RK_WM_APP_NAME="YourWindowName"
  ```

### Tray icon doesn't appear

- Some desktop environments hide tray icons. Check your panel settings
- On GNOME, you may need the [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

### Black screen / overlay issues

- On Wayland, RuneKit selects Qt's `xcb` backend automatically. The game must also expose an X11/XWayland window; native Wayland game windows cannot be captured by this backend.
- The native Linux RuneScape client launched through Bolt was verified on CachyOS/Plasma Wayland with one display at 100% scale. Mixed-scale and multi-monitor layouts still need live testing.
- If game detection fails, check `xprop` against the game window. Start RuneScape before opening an Alt1 app.

### "Failed to load module xapp-gtk3-module"

- This is a harmless warning from your desktop environment. Ignore it.

### "GBM is not supported" / Vulkan fallback

- On the tested NVIDIA setup, Qt WebEngine uses Vulkan rendering when GBM is unavailable. This message alone does not indicate a capture failure.

## Bug Reports

For issues reproducible in upstream RuneKit Reforged, open an upstream GitHub Issue and **include your log file**.

RuneKit automatically saves logs to:

```
~/.config/cupco.de/RuneKit/logs/runekit.log
```

Logs rotate automatically (3 files, 1MB each) so they won't fill your disk.

**To submit a bug report:**

1. Reproduce the issue
2. Find your log file (see path above)
3. Open an [upstream GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged/issues/new) with:
   - What you were doing when it broke
   - Your distro and desktop environment (e.g., "Ubuntu 24.04, GNOME on X11")
   - Attach or paste your `runekit.log` file

## Settings

Open the settings dialog:
```sh
poetry run python main.py settings
```

## Debugging

Close RuneKit, then enable the Chromium profiler on the next launch:
```sh
./RuneKit.sh --devtools-port 9222
```
For an already installed development environment, use
`poetry run python main.py --devtools-port 9222` instead.

Open Clue Trainer from RuneKit, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:9222` in
Chrome/Chromium and select its page. In **Performance**, record 15–30 seconds
while reproducing the expensive activity, stop recording, and save the profile.
Record idle and active clue solving separately. Use **Memory** for heap snapshots
if investigating growth over time.

This profiles the embedded browser's JavaScript and rendering. Python screen
capture and X11 polling run in the host process and require a separate Python
profiler. GPU acceleration is already enabled by Qt when available; enabling
DevTools does not change the rendering backend. The debugging endpoint binds to
localhost and is disabled by default (unless configured through the environment).
See [Qt WebEngine debugging](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.10/qtwebengine-debugging.html).

Add `--debug` for verbose RuneKit logs, including capture requests. Leave it off
when measuring normal overhead, since tracing adds logging work to each request.

RuneKit implements `bindFindSubImg` on bound capture snapshots. Clue Trainer
automatically uses this native image-search path, returning coordinates instead
of transferring the search image into JavaScript. Matching preserves the Alt1
JavaScript fallback's alpha-weighted RGB tolerance, row order, and 51-match cap.
Restart RuneKit after updating to load changes to its injected browser API.

Large native image searches use a dedicated PyOpenCL backend by default when available.
RuneKit uploads each bound snapshot once, filters and verifies candidates on
the GPU, and collects the first 51 matches in row order on the GPU. Only a
208-byte result buffer is downloaded per search. Small searches and systems
without a compatible GPU use the CPU path. Launch normally:

```sh
./RuneKit.sh
```

The launcher installs the `gpu` dependency extra by default.
For a development environment, use `poetry install --extras gpu`, then
`poetry run python main.py`. Include live GPU correctness checks
with `RUNEKIT_OPENCL_TESTS=1` when running the development test suite.

Set `RUNEKIT_OPENCL=0` to use the CPU matcher and skip installing the GPU extra.
Missing GPU dependencies or an unavailable GPU automatically fall back to CPU.
